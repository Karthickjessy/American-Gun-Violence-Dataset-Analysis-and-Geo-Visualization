                          “Gun Violence is not something that appears just in a bad neighborhood or in another part of
                                   the world. It appears right here, right outside the door” – Stephen Young.
Gun violence is one of the serious threats which is faced by citizens in many of the countries today.
Even though many countries are affected by gun violence, the United States of America is probably
the most affected country in the world. According the statistics report released by the BBC, the rate of
murder or manslaughter by firearm is the maximum in the developed world. A count of 11,000 deaths
were recorded which involves firearms, according to the survey in 2017. This data analysis and
prediction project mainly concentrates on gun violence which occurred in the United States of America
from the year 2013 – 2018. Within the report we analyze demographic variables such as age, gender,
date of the incident happened, gun laws in the US, literacy rates, and suicide rates from each of the
states in the US. With the help of the predictors like date of incident we are trying to predict future gun
violence events. From this analysis we obtained some interesting findings related to the most
dangerous times of year in terms of gun violence incidents and the predicted most dangerous state and
city in the future. These predictions are performed using machine learning concepts. We also attempt
to predict the most vulnerable and safest (day of the week, month of the year and states) in the US with
a help of predictive scoring scheme by giving a sensible weighting to the parameters. We show that
this result matches with the machine learning predictions. This project also considers whether factors
like gun laws, literacy rate, population and suicide rates have any association with the gun violence
incidents happening in the US. Once, after analyzing all these we attempt to grade each of the US
states with the help of scoring scheme and generate some interesting results
